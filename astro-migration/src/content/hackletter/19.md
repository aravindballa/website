_Hi, Iâ€™m Aravind Balla and you are reading letter #18 from the Hackletter where I talk about my learnings and give you behind the scenes of things I keep doing for fun._

## Side Project chit chat

If you don't know it already, I'm working on a side-project. And trying to build in the public by tweeting when I work.

Few days back, I had a conversation with [Reddy](https://reddy2go.com/) where we talked about why I'm building [Stackblocks](https://stackblocks.app/) on the side, the progress and the future of this product.

Here is the link to listen to it - [https://racket.com/reddy2go/rG58n](https://racket.com/reddy2go/rG58n)

Or I have put up the complete transcript of our conversation on my website. You can [check that out](https://aravindballa.com/writings/conversation-on-why-stackblocks/) as well.

I'm loving building parts of it and progressing on it daily. More stories and learning to come.

### No Hackletter next week â›°

I will be on a vacation next week. I could write something early and schedule it so that it reaches you on time, but ...

You can say I'm already in vacation mode. I'm going on a trek in the Himalayas. It's going to be great. Expect the next letter to be about this.

See you the next Tuesday. ðŸ‘‹

_Thanks for reading. Forward this to your friends if you think theyâ€™ll enjoy too._
