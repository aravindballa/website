Solving something is good. When it is for yourself, meaning when you solve your own problem, it's the **best**.

But to make it a successful Saas, there are a lot of factors to consider. Building it in way that is scale-able is the obvious part. Building it is actually the small part of the big system.

Finding the right audience is the key. Or customers as people call it. That problem needs to be a real big problem to people and they should be ready to pay for it.

And your solution should be solving it easily or save a lot time time for the users.

> Successful businesses are built by solving critical problems for an audience that will pay for a solution to their issues.

I'm reading this book right now and it is really enlightening. Right when I'm planning to build a Saas on the side. I will write a complete review when I finish reading this.
