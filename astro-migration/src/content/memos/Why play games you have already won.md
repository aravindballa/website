I used to play a lot of video games as a kid. Although, I could not stick with a game for long. I used to switch a lot as I got bored very easily.

When I completed a game, I never used to go back and play again.  It never interested me to play a game twice.

Why? Because the rewards stop coming in.

This conversation, between Derek and Tim, reminded me of that.

As I grew up, I forgot how to play.

What games have you been playing that you won already and not getting rewards anymore?
