I wanted something that tracks where I spend my time. I've tried various apps to do it, but nothing clicked. I often forget to stop the timers. 🤦🏻‍♂️ ⏲

At last, I found the sweet spot for it in [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). I use it for **Interstitial Journaling** already. So I built a plugin which analyses those logs and gives me a summary of my time in the current week.

I've put the source code on Gumroad. It's basically FREE but you can pay-what-you-want if you want to support me for the time spent.
