Github Actions are really powerful. I like to see them as personal assistants. You tell your assistants to do some work for you. Similarly, you tell Github actions to do some job for you.

I've recorded a video while building this. If you'd like to watch me build, here is the video ðŸ‘‡

The main usecase for these actions, I feel, is when we use it to publish your library to npm or deploying your app on S3 or Github Pages whenever you push new changes. CI/CD - like the techies call it.

These actions can be triggered in different scenarios. In the above usecase, it is triggered on `push`. Similarly, you can also do it on a `pull-request` where we run a few checks or welcome new contributors to the project.

Another way to trigger an action is on a `schedule`, which is what I used to make the action Tweet everyday. ðŸ—“We can give CRON expressions to schedule the triggers for the action.

_Okay, where do we tell all these things to the Action? There's got to be some config, right?_

Yeah. We have a `yaml` file for every action and we specify all the configuration for it there. All the yamls for your actions lie in `.github/workflows` path in your GitHub repo.

This is the action config I wrote

(Trimmed version. Full code [here](https://github.com/aravindballa/learningcurve.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/tweet.yml))

```yml
name: Tweet

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 10,16 * * *'
```

Now we know how to schedule things. Next step?

## Tweet

We know there should be an API to post tweets. But for that, you need a few API credentials from Twitter. This was a big time taking process for me as the application for a dev account on Twitter had to go through a few reviews from Twitter employees.

Once you get the credentials, tweeting is as easy as the code below.

[Full Code](https://github.com/aravindballa/learningcurve.dev/blob/master/scripts/getQuote.js)

```js
const Twitter = require('twitter');

const client = new Twitter({
  consumer_key: process.env.TWITTER_API_KEY,
  consumer_secret: process.env.TWITTER_API_SECRET,
  access_token_key: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY,
  access_token_secret: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
});

client.post('statuses/update', { status: tweet }, function (error, tweet, response) {
  if (!error) {
    console.log(tweet);
  }
});
```

I have this in a file `scripts/getQuote.js` and I run using `yarn tweet`. We add a script in `package.json` to be able to do this.

```json
"scripts": {
  "tweet": "node  scripts/getQuote.js",
}
```

## Last step

What's remaining now is that we tell our Action to run `yarn tweet` and that's it.

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Tweet it yo
        run: |
          yarn install
          yarn tweet
        env:
          CI: true
          TWITTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_API_KEY }}
          TWITTER_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_API_SECRET }}
          TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY }}
          TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}
```

If you observe, we pass the Twitter API credentials as environment variables. This can be done in the Repo settings in GitHub. You can add a few secrets and they get passed to the Actions in that repo.
