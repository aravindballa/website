The question that I explored [last time](https://aravindballa.com/writings/ai-coworker/), which is “Can AI be your coworker?”, is answered now.

With ChatGPT, its a sure shot YES.

I mean, go on to Twitter and search for "chatgpt", you'll find overwhelming responses on what its capable of doing.

I was now pondering on the question **"How can it help me"**, personally, taking in the context of my environment, the things I consume, where I live etc.

Things I read – Aha!

I know I have collected quotes from the books I read, and they ARE valuable. _“Maybe there is a way to train the AI on all these quotes and ask it for insights based on it”_, I wondered.

Right in time, I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3RTA9ZbEPw) where Sahil, the founder of Gumroad, talks about how he built [askmybook.com](https://askmybook.com). He trained the AI on his book called The Minimalist Entrepreneur, and it answers questions based on that book.

It was perfect for my use case.

Created a fresh repository and started hacking together bit and pieces. A lot of examples were in python, which isn’t a language of comfort for me. With the help of ChatGPT I translated code to JavaScript and adapted them.

Couple of hours later, I ended up with this.

The questions now - Will anyone else want this? If so, how can make this customizable? Will I run out of my free OpenAI GPT credits?

I'd like to know what you think?
