You get to switch contexts at an enormous pace and your brain gets hooked. Now, it always wants it, and we’re doomed!

But life happens in a slow pace.

It takes time for a flower to blossom
It takes time …

It takes time to brew coffee
It takes time to finish a book
It takes time enjoy your meal

What do we do then? Pull out our phones and get back the dopamine kicking feeds. Insta & Twitter

I find myself guilty of - closing the app and opening it again immediately unconsciously.

Happens to you too?

Why are our brains wired like this? - Because we aren’t taking control

What can we do?

- Be okay with missing out
- Embrace long form content like books, podcasts etc
- Set your intentions with Social Media
- Use Lists instead of Twitter's default feed

An excellent summary of Digital minimalism by the man himself, Cal Newport - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsGKzjyj_6Q

No wonder why he isn't on social media.
