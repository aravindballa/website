GitHub issues can become a nice interlinked digital garden. ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ² ðŸŒ³

I've seen people use it as a CMS for their blogs. The inspiration comes from OneGraph's [blog example](https://github.com/OneGraph/essay.dev/). I [loved it](https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1414630464002871297).

A garden, which is **interlinked**, can be done as well.

Swyx did that for his blog. He wrote a post about it - [Moving to a GitHub CMS](https://www.swyx.io/github-cms).

A few repos that embrace GitHub Issues as a CMS -

- [Swyx Kit](https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit)
- [OneGraph's essay.dev](https://github.com/OneGraph/essay.dev/)
- [Github Blog - An API to fetch blog posts from Issues](https://github.com/renatorib/github-blog)
- [muhajir.dev](https://github.com/muhajirdev/muhajir.dev/)

**A nice inbuilt feature** - You can see to which notes a particular note is linked in the mentions.

I played with GitHub's GraphQL API and it gives me a prefect response to create a website from these notes

I have a basic working version up here - [https://github-issues-garden.netlify.app](https://github-issues-garden.netlify.app) ðŸŽ‰

The pages comes from Issues of the repository - [https://github.com/aravindballa/github-issues-garden](https://github.com/aravindballa/github-issues-garden)
