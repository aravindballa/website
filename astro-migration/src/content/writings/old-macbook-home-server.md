We hoard giga bytes of data, and that grows every single day. With phones in our pockets becoming overly capable of recording 4k videos and capturing hi-res RAW pictures, we keep on accumulating pixels.

I need a place to store the media I capture.

My phone is out of storage. My laptop will soon be out of storage. An external hard disk drive has already failed on me in the past. I cannot deal with data loss again.

At some point in my life, I would like to own a NAS.

But for now it is expensive and getting one in India is only going to make it more expensive.
