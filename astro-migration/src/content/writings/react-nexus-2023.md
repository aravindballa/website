- Great talks
  - Added a few links to resources at the end, which might be useful
- Talking to speakers about what makes a great talk
  - Find good stuff from Matheus blog post and write here
  - Learnings from Tejas
- On the state of browsers
- Felt like I should have recorded the conversations and carry them with me
- Random resources
