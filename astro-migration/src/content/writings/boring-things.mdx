You read that right. In order to become better, do boring things **consistently**.

Let me explain.

The boring stuff, things which are not Snapchat-able or Instagram-able, are the ones that make you better.

Eating at home is boring. Working out is boring. Reading a book is boring. Journaling is boring.

Note that every activity is not boring to every person. It differs.

## Why is it hard to do these things?

We are **dopamine junkies**. That's the reason behind scrolling these infinite feeds all day. Apps from the big companies, like Instagram, Twitter etc, have properly taken advantage of this.

They don't do you any good other than stimulating you.

But the boring activities don't give you the dopamine. So it's not interesting.

## Why should you still do them?

Because you want to become a better you. No kidding.

Have you heard about compounding? It's where your results in turn help you get more of them. For example, profits from you financial investments help you earn more profits when reinvested.

Most of the boring activities compound.

If you workout every day, which is boring, you get healthier and stronger. The stronger you can lift even heavier weights making you more stronger.
See?

## But, how can you keep doing them?

**Reward yourself frequently.** After you eat home cooked boring food all week, reward yourself with a cheat meal.

Constantly ask yourself how can I make this interesting? For example - Journaling everyday is boring. You can make it interesting by keeping a list of prompts and choosing to journal about a random prompt.

That's all for now.
