_Hi, Iâ€™m Aravind Balla and you are reading letter #14 from the Hackletter where I talk about my learnings and give you behind the scenes of things I keep doing for fun._

I wrote an article on **what I do before ending my coding sessions**, at work and for my personal projects.

Here is the link - [https://aravindballa.com/writings/ending-your-coding-sessions-right/](https://aravindballa.com/writings/ending-your-coding-sessions-right/)

Long story short, I take notes while I code, add comments for my future self to preserve the context. And this helps me pick back up faster and start coding. I no longer spend 20 minutes recollecting what I had done and where I should resume.

In the article, I compare this to travelling with a map.

If this resonates, I'd encourage you to checkout the article, or put this in your read-later apps if you prefer it that way. Here is the link again - [https://aravindballa.com/writings/ending-your-coding-sessions-right/](https://aravindballa.com/writings/ending-your-coding-sessions-right/)

See you next Tuesday ðŸ‘‹
