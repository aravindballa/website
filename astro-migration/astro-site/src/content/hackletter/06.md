Hello, hope you are well in these crazy times. It wasn't a productive week for me since the last Tuesday. But I could manage to ship a few updates to my new website over the weekend.

Repo I'm working on - [https://github.com/aravindballa/website](https://github.com/aravindballa/website)

I have nothing to share in this letter as I hardly wrote anything.

On Learning curve podcast, we published an **episode on NFTs**. It's available on your podcast players if you've already subscribed or here are the links

That's all for this letter. Stay safe. Wear a mask if you go out. Take care.
