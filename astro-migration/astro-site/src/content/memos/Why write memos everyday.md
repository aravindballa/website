When I started, 2 days ago, I didn't know what the actual goal with them is. I generally have my **why** figured out before even I start something. Like the case with [podcast](https://aravindballa.com/writings/starting-podcast/) or my [side-project](https://aravindballa.com/writings/conversation-on-why-stackblocks/).

I just did it because my friends [Sreekar](https://sreekarscribbles.com) and [Vidya](https://personal.vidya.so) were doing it. And they would make wonderful accountability partners.

Although, this wasn't the sole reason. There were times in the past when I had thoughts of publishing daily. My friends doing it gave me the right push.

Main goal with this is to build that publishing muscle. We consume a lot of info but fail to produce or put out our thoughts. We don't express as much.

This is an outlet, a way to express.

The last step in Tiago's CODE framework (from Building a Second Brain book) is E for Express.

I don't want to gain a huge popularity or following by doing this. I just want to attract the right kind of minds that spark with the ideas I put out and be sparked my the conversations that could take place.

Writing and publishing daily would mean an opportunity everyday to do that.

I'm just [increasing my surface area for luck](https://buttondown.email/aravindballa/archive/increasing-your-luck/).
