**What gets measured, gets improved**.

I believe that statement is true. I wanted to apply that how I feel / my mood.

But I had a lot of questions. Can I accurately do it? What does it mean to track your mood - What are you actually tracking? My mood changes every hour, so should I track hourly? Or a general idea of how my day was is enough?

_Internet did it's trick._ You know it listens to us and our feeds are full of the things we think of, right? That happened. Came across a [video from Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA4-qQ5wEns&pp=ygUObWF0dCBkJ2F2ZWxsYSA%3D) where he talks about his 365 days mood tracking experience.

I realised I didn't need extreme tracking mechanismsâ€“just the overall mood for the day. This decision would also be simple to start with.

I tracked the last 7 days.

I'm using the same [app](https://daylio.net/) that Matt uses. I like the ability to write a summary of the day. Initially did it on Apple Health app (you can log mood from iOS 17 which is currently in beta) but this didn't have a place to write summary. (Might change in the future)

UPDATE: Now using `How we feel` app.

How its affecting me - I'm more conscious of how my day is. Instead of just experiencing the day as it is, I am putting efforts to make it better.

When I keep up with this habit and add more days, I will have few insights. For example, [Vidya](https://twitter.com/learnwithvidya/status/1619964161919946754) found out she is least productive / energetic on Tuesdays.

In a month from now, I will write about this again.

~~Have a great day.~~ Do something that makes your day great.
