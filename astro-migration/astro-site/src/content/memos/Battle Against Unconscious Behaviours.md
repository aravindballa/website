I've tried to get rid of unconscious behaviours like opening Instagram automatically after unlocking the phone.

I used to do this a lot. When hit enter and the code is compiling, I pull up the phone. When waiting in a line, I pull up the phone. Opening Insta was an un-mindful act.

Its no more fun, mainly because \[\[Infinite feeds are robbing the joy of your life\]\].

What worked in the past was uninstalling it completely. But its extremes.

_I wanted to find a middle-way._

I experimented with an iOS automation that runs when ever I open Insta it prompts me to type something, like why I want to use it.

But its very easy to surpass this. I started typing gibberish to pass that step.

Now, I've setup [OneSec app](https://one-sec.app/) to show me a screen and make me wait for some time before proceeding to Insta.

This is helping me act mindfully and blocking the unconscious behaviour. I constantly get shocked observing how many times I open it.

These kind of interventions to stop addictive behaviours is [research backed](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03028.x).
