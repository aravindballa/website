Ability get stuff done while roaming around is a skill which can be built. I've been practising this for almost 4 years now and this is what I learnt.

- when you are not your home office or office in general, it's hard to get into the zone
- Day feels cluttered, too much disorganisation
- You can use a schedule because there won't be any structure to your day
- Your thoughts will be all over the place

- routines help
  - Morning routine where you write mooring pages to empty your mind and plan out tasks for your day.
  - Evening routine of what went well and what didn't
- Plan short blocks of deep work session
- Your ability to go in and out of deep work improves with deliberate practice.
