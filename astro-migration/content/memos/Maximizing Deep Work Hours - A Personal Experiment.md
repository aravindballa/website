I used to get very less work done in my day.
Always stopping my urges for distraction, finding myself scrolling feeds whenever there is a chance to.

Now, I feel content with what I get done.

I feel getting focused work done is a muscle that you can train.
Just like you can train to run longer distances. 
There is obviously a limit to it.
4 hours of deep work is my sweet spot now.
Not to mention a lot of the shallow work that keeps happening.

One side effect of doing good fulfilling work in your day is that you can happily enjoy evenings guilt free.

## Starting the day right

Starting my day with work, after spending minimal time needed to freshen up though, is a sure shot way of setting the day in a good motion.

For me, that's starting work by 6am.
Is that necessary?
I don't think so.

I have always liked the peaceful early mornings as a kid.
Now, it feels like the world around me is still asleep and I can work without being bothered.

Our brain tricks us into thinking starting work is easy.

Let me scroll Twitter for a minute.
Let me check Insta quickly.
Let me pick a video to watch before I get into the zone.

Getting into the zone only becomes hard later.

Focus is a muscle.
Its weak initially and we will only want more distractions throughout the day.

## Optimizing the phone

Or I should say making the phone a bit dumber.

The idea is to not let it trigger you into distractions during work.

My home screen is empty.
Just the essential apps, like call, are in the dock.

**Blocking social media**, any apps that have infinite feeds for that matter, has turned out to be peaceful.
Lowering stimulation also helps with building that ability focus.

From 6pm onwards, I unblock everything. Widgets and apps on the home screen are back [^1].
The phone is then used as its supposed to be, enjoying all its features.

As I am not eliminating/uninstalling apps completely, I feel this is a lot more sustainable.
I know I will have time for social media in the evenings so the FOMO is less.

I call this **Intermittent feed fasting**.

This makes the work look more interesting and fulfilling for me.
Urge to check feeds, that constant need of stimulation is reduced.

I've been more than a month into this now and this is whats working for me.
Everything I mention here might work for you or you might not need to do all the things I do.

Remember, in this day and age, your ability to focus defines what you can achieve.
