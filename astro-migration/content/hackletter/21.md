_Hi, I’m Aravind Balla and you are reading letter #18 from the Hackletter where I talk about my learnings and give you behind the scenes of things I keep doing for fun._

When I build apps or websites, the first thing I want to do is to write code. Because that is what I'm comfortable with and I like to write code. But with experience, I understood that without proper planning it will take multiple iterations to get to the final outcome.

And when **we want to iterate in code, that becomes costly**. Not actual money, but time.

This is where planning helps. If it's frontend, then a few designs and flows about how the app should look and work. And if it's backend, database and API design.

This actually **makes writing code easier**. Iterating while designing is a lot easier compared to changing code. You just have to move blocks and text around when you are designing.

### But to what extent?

Should you have every granular detail planned out? I don't think so. It differs from person to person.

I like making some rough sketches for the planned UI. Basically, taking all the decisions while designing so that I can sit and code what's planned without thinking about it much.

How does it work for you? I'm curious to know.

_Thanks for reading. Forward this to your friends if you think they’ll enjoy too._
