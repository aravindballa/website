Hey,

Happy [Ugadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugadi). I hope you and everyone at home is well.

## Incremental Static generation

Or regeneration for that matter. I wrote a [blog post](https://aravindballa.com/writings/incremental-static-generation) on this topic. I recently discovered this and have become a huge fan of it, until I also came to know the downsides of it.

TL;DR of the complete post - **ISR is sprinkling SSR benefits on top of SSG**.

> ISR - Incremental Static Regeneration
> SSR - Server-side Rendering
> SSG - Static site generation

Now read that again.

The thing is â€“ it is not prefect, like all the other things in web development. And it has downsides like the first visit not being up-to date.

I cover more on this topic in the blog post. Here is [the link](https://aravindballa.com/writings/incremental-static-generation) if you'd like to read more.

And if you want to suggest edits or throw more light on the topic, we can talk about it.

I've started to rebuild [my website](https://aravindballa.com/) using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). It was on Gatsby till now and I feel it's slowing me down when I want to add a few features.

This is [the repo](https://github.com/aravindballa/website) if you want to have a look. I will be sharing my progress on YT. [Subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2y7GYWCZtXApu6iQmlmFnw) if you'd like to follow along.

Have a great week. See you next Tuesday!
