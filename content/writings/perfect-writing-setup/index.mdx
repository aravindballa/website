The setup involves 2 apps, Working Copy & iA Writer, and my iPad. And it costs ₹1799 + ₹2699.

**Working Copy** is a Git client for iOS and iPadOS. I works really well to clone, add new commits and push (requires a pro subscription, hence ₹1799 cost).

**iA Writer** is a beautiful, focused, markdown writing app. Its the one you see in the picture above.

## How it works together

Working copy clones the repositories to the Files locally. I open the repo in iA Writer and edit / add new content. I go back to Working Copy, select the changes and push. The website is updated. 🎉

## Things I like in this setup

- **Offline first**. I can open and start writing on iPad irrespective of the network connection
- **Syncs** directly to GitHub, so it gets built and deployed when updated.
- It looks beautiful, keeps me focused and lets me use my **iPad**. Which is good because, I don’t want to open / sit with my laptop after work.

## Bonus

When ever I open iA Writer, [Shortcuts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id915249334?mt=8) (automations) make sure the content I have is up to date by pulling content from the repository. Thanks [Quinn](https://twitter.com/com/status/1364637833965797378?s=21)!

I still manually commit the changes from Working Copy app as I don’t want to push commits (and re deploy the website) every time I close the app.

This is likely to evolve or discarded completely. 😅
I’ll post the updates here as usual.
