Finding time to work on your side projects is difficult.

Especially when you have a day job which task which takes up your time and energy. And if you have other commitments, like kids, you know that becomes complicated.

It makes you feel like you aren't making enough progress on your side projects. Right?

## Sacred Side Hustle Hours

Best thing you can do for your side projects is to block few sacred side hustle hours everyday.

What is a sacred hour? It is the time when

- You are **not (or very less) answerable to people**. People don't expect replies from you.
- You have the **energy for the kind of work** you are planning to do.
- You can find this time **consistently**, hopefully at the same time of the day.

When you have kids, maybe it's when they are asleep or when you partner is looking after them. If you are a student, maybe it's after college. If you have a day job, maybe it is one hour early in the morning before you begin your day job.

**Having the energy** is also equally important. Even if you find the right time and you are all drained, it's of no help. Tweak your schedule to preserve some energy.

Deciding a time and place for you scared hour makes you stick to it for longer. At 8pm everyday in your living room couch, you work on this project - how does that sound? James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits actually.

## Prepping for a sacred hour

The prep actually should start way early from your sacred hour. You should not be spending time thinking of what to work on in your sacred hour.

Maintain a [list of things you want to work](https://hackletter.email/37) and [prioritize](https://aravindballa.com/writings/prioritization-for-side-projects/) them.

When your sacred hour starts, just pick the one on top and start working.

That's how you can make the most of your sacred hours. Ideas don't come when you want them to. Having a list helps you write them whenever your get one.

All you have to do then, is to excitedly wait to work on your side hustle and make loads of progress.
