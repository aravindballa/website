I contributed to Bismuth Community recently where I helped build a [voting tool](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-Voting/tree/master/client-side/src). The community was so generous. I loved the [gratitude](https://twitter.com/BismuthPlatform/status/1185265743576862722) they showed towards me. They just started BisBabble where they interview contributors to the community. I feel honoured to be the first one the series.

Here is the interview - [https://hypernodes.bismuth.live/?p=1033](https://hypernodes.bismuth.live/?p=1033)
