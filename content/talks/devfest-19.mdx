## Notes

- **Why people don't do it**
  - I'm not an expert
    - You don't have to be one
    - You will be helping someone at Level 0 to come to Level 1
    - Triangle - a lot of the people are beginners (at the base)
  - Someone already wrote about it
    - Think about journalists - do you really think one does not cover news because another fellow already thought about it?
  - Why write the same thing
    - What about your view on that topic?
    - What if all others are difficult to understand and you nail it for a beginner?
- **Why you should actually do it?**

  - Help others
  - When you try to explain something, you learn it better.
  - If someone looks at your blog, they know you are familiar with things
  - I'm not asking you to write only tech, write anything

    > It is a blog, sure, but it is also a wiki. It's a spot where I can post ideas, snippets, resources, thoughts, collections, and other bits and pieces that I find interesting and useful. Instead of always being a "performance" level of blogging, it can be a looser more human endeavor that drops the idea of robots sorting the content (in this case simply by date created) and embraces the idea of curation, by me, for you.

    - Write how you wish things should be
    - If you like a course that you took recently, write why.
    - If you are building something, journal the progress
    - Consider your blog as a digital garden
